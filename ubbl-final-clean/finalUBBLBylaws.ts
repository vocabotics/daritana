By-law  177.  Computing  number  of  staircases  and  staircase  width. The  following  factors  shall  be  used  in  computing  the  exit  widths: (a)  in  a  multi-storey  building  if  x  units  of  exit  width  are  required  from  each  floor  the  staircases serving  those  floors  do  not  need  to  be  x  times  the  number  of  floors  served  in  units  of  exit  width. The staircases need be only wide enough to serve each floor but not less than the minimum width allowed  and  in  every  case  one  of  the  exit  staircases  shall  be  assumed  to  be  inaccessible  and  the remaining  exit  staircase  shall  be  of  sufficient  width  and  number  to  accommodate  the  relevant occupancy; [Amendment  2021] (b)  depending  on  the  occupancy,  street  floor  exits  have  to  be  sized  to  handle  not  only  the  occupant load  of  the  street  floor  but  also  a  percentage  of  the  load  of  the  exits  discharging  to  the  street floor  from  floors  above  and  below; (c) exits should never decrease in width along their length of travel and, if two or more exits converge into  a  common  exit,  the  common  exit  should  never  be  narrower  than  the  sum  of  the  width  of  the exits  converging  into  it; (d)  except  as  provided  in  these  By-laws,  the  minimum  number  of  exits  is  two; (e) at least one of the staircases should be a minimum of two units width except that 900 millimetres may  be  allowed  where  total  occupancy  of  all  floors  served  by  staircases  is  less  than  50;  and (f) there should be no decrease in width along the path of travel of a staircase leading to a final exit.

Required  aisle  space  serving  the  fixed  seats  shall  not  be  used  to  increase  the  occupant load. By-law  181.  Width  of  means  of  egress. Means  of  egress  shall  be  measured  in  units  of  exits  width  of  550  millimetres.
