# VIRAL GROWTH & COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOR DARITANA ARCHITECT PLATFORM

## Executive Summary: The Disruptive Vision

Transform Daritana from a project management tool into Malaysia's central design ecosystem hub through revolutionary community-driven marketplace dynamics that create unstoppable network effects.

## 1. CORE DISRUPTIVE CONCEPT: "The Design Mafia Effect"

### The Strategy
Create an exclusive yet accessible professional network where being "outside" puts you at a competitive disadvantage.

   - Show real-time project values flowing through platform
   - Display "Professionals of the Week" on billboards
   - Create social pressure to join
